 Project Name: Automated Report Generation
 
 Developer: Sushree Gayatri Nayak
 
 Internship Task

🚀 Overview
In today’s data-driven world, automated report generation is essential for efficiency and accuracy. This project automates the process of analyzing data, generating visualizations, and exporting reports as PDFs using Python. It eliminates manual efforts, ensuring fast and error-free reporting.

This project is built with Python, utilizing pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and ReportLab to handle datasets, create insightful visualizations, and generate professional reports in PDF format.

📌 Key Features
✅ Data Handling: Reads and processes structured datasets (CSV format).
✅ Automated Charts & Graphs: Generates bar charts, pie charts, and other visuals for better insights.
✅ PDF Report Generation: Automatically compiles results into a well-structured PDF report.
✅ Customizable: Easily adaptable for different datasets and reporting requirements.
✅ User-Friendly: Requires minimal user input, making it efficient and reliable.

🔧 Technologies Used
🔹 Python – The core programming language for processing and automation.
🔹 pandas – For handling and analyzing tabular data.
🔹 Matplotlib – To generate various visual representations.
🔹 NumPy – For numerical and statistical operations.
🔹 ReportLab – To create and format PDF reports dynamically.
